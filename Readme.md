# rest-hateoas-client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mercateo/rest-hateoas-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mercateo/rest-hateoas-client) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Mercateo/rest-hateoas-client/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Mercateo/rest-hateoas-client?branch=master)
A very simple HATEOAS client for java. Note, that it is in an alpha state and subject of changes. 

There is an example package in the client which will be moved out in a later version. To make it run one needs to run the example server which can be found [here](https://github.com/Mercateo/rest-demo-feature).
